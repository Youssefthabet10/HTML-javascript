	<p id="kalam">First up, Chicken and Guacamole Tostadas are the weeknight cook's dream come true. The secret here is taking rotisserie (or any pre-cooked chicken) and tossing with smoked paprika, giving the chicken rich, grill-like flavor—with no cooking. Mash up a homemade guac and stir together the salsa, and you’ve got a truly fresh meal with no cook time. Add in a few of the jalapeño seeds for extra heat.Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.
